# Cyber Security Simulator

This is the repository containing the source code for our bachelor thesis project.
The project was requested by the Norwegian Cyber Range, through the product owner: Muhammad Mudassar Yamin.

## Description

The goal for this project was to create a prototype of a cyber security simulator type serious game consisting of an editor for creating scenarios as well as the functionality to play a created scenario. In a scenario the attacker and defender sides (red and blue) are played by participants, either teams or individuals. It is a high-level system that focuses on making the right decisions regarding cyber security when dealing with a certain scenario.
